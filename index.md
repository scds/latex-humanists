# Welcome to LaTeX for Humanists 

LaTeX is a typesetting and document creation program that has a lot of traction in STEM areas (compsci and maths especially, due to its facility with mathematical symbols) but very little pickup with folks in the Humanities. At this session, John Fink (Digital Scholarship Librarian) will discuss why this doesn’t have to be the case.

We’ll learn about how LaTeX can be used by Humanities scholars and discuss topics like what makes *typesetting* different from a *word processor*, why LaTeX still has resonance today despite being invented in the 1970s, why maths nerds love the program, and why people who might ordinarily use Word might want to think about maybe not using Word.
